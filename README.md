# CS31 - UCLA, Winter Quarter 2023
This Repository contains my homework/project solutions for UCLA Winter 2023 CS31 (Introduction to Computer Science I) with Professor Bruce Huang. In this course, I learned the foundation concepts and principles of computer science; fundamental computer programming principles, methodologies, and techniques; and basic concepts of programming in general and the C++ language specifically. The course consisted of 6 projects with Project 3 being my favorite. 

<strong>Disclaimer: </strong> This repository is only meant to showcase my work for professional purposes. If you are a student at UCLA taking CS31, do not copy or re-use any of my code and view this repository at your own risk.
